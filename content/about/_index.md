This is my about page. :wave:

I am a PhD candidate advised by Dr. Yali Jia in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Oregon Health & Science University. My research focuses on the development of optic coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA).

As a research assistant in Center for Ophthalmic Optics and Lasers (COOL) at Casey Eye Institute, I contribute to plan, design and conduct highly technical and complex research projects in consultation with supervisor/colleagues; contribute to the development of new concepts, techniques and standards; analyze research data and provide interpretation (projects including segmentation, registration and quantification of OCT angiography); contribute to the development of research documentation for publication and prepare technique reports, papers and grant applications.
