As the technology improves| larger fields of view that capture information away from the macular are being explored in order to provide an enhanced ability to detect pathology. However| normative measurements for important OCTA metrics like vessel density and intercapillary distance are not currently well-characterized in the peripheral retina. In this prospective study| we measured vessel density and intercapillary distance of the superficial vascular complex| ganglion cell layer plexus| and deep capillary plexus in montaged macular/temporal scans from 53 (33 men) healthy volunteers. Vessel density and intercapillary distance were also compared across different regions of the retina| including along arcs at separate distance from the fovea. Compared to the central macular region| the temporal retina had significantly lower vessel density| decreased thickness| and greater intercapillary distance in the superficial vascular complex| GCLP ganglion cell layer plexus| and deep capillary plexus (Wilcoxon rank sum test P?<?0.001)| with each of the plexuses examined here showing a general decrease in vessel density and an increase in intercapillary distance towards the temporal region. No significant difference was noted comparing corresponding vessel density and intercapillary distance regions above and below the macula| and multiple linear regression showed that age and intraocular pressure were not associated with vessel density and intercapillary distance in most models. Repeatability analysis reported as intraclass correlation coefficients demonstrated moderate to excellent reliability of vessel density and intercapillary distance in all OCTA layers. These results should help provide an enhanced baseline to help identify vascular pathology in the peripheral retina.,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15353702211036704,Liu K| Guo Y| You Q| Hormel T| Hwang TS| Jia Y.

In this study| we developed a deep-learning-based method to segment vessels in the superficial vascular plexus (SVP)| intermediate capillary plexus (ICP)| and deep capillary plexus (DCP) directly from volumetric OCTA data. The method contains a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting distinct retinal layers| a custom projection module to generate three vascular plexuses from OCTA data| and three parallel CNNs to segment vasculature. Experimental results on OCTA data from rat eyes demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method. This end-to-end network has the potential to simplify OCTA data processing on retinal vasculature segmentation. The main contribution of this study is that we propose a custom projection module to connect retinal layer segmentation and vasculature segmentation modules and automatically convert data from three to two dimensions| thus establishing an end-to-end method to segment three retinal capillary plexuses from volumetric OCTA without any human intervention.,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353062327_An_end-to-end_network_for_segmenting_the_vasculature_of_three_retinal_capillary_plexuses_from_OCT_angiographic_volumes?uploadChannel=invalid,Yukun Guo| Tristan T.

Because photoreceptors are found in the outer retina and rely primarily on the trophic support of the underlying choriocapillaris| imaging of flow or lack thereof in choriocapillaris by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has great clinical potential in AMD assessment. We introduce a metric using OCTA| named ?focal perfusion loss? (FPL) to describe the effects of age and non-neovascular AMD on choriocapillaris flow. Because OCTA imaging of choriocapillaris is vulnerable to artifacts?namely motion| projections| segmentation errors| and shadows?they are removed by postprocessing software. The shadow detection software is a machine learning algorithm recently developed for the evaluation of the retinal circulation and here adapted for choriocapillaris analysis. It aims to exclude areas with unreliable flow signal due to blocking of the OCT beam by objects anterior to the choriocapillaris (e.g.| drusen| retinal vessels| vitreous floaters| and iris). We found that both the FPL and the capillary density were able to detect changes in the choriocapillaris of AMD and healthy age-matched subjects with respect to young controls. The dominant cause of shadowing in AMD is drusen| and the shadow exclusion algorithm helps determine which areas under drusen retain sufficient signal for perfusion evaluation and which areas must be excluded. Such analysis allowed us to determine unambiguously that choriocapillaris density under drusen is indeed reduced.,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.NPh.6.4.041108,Camino A| Guo Y| You QS| Wang J| Huang D| Bailey ST| Jia Y.

However| the sizes of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) have a significant variation in normal population| preventing the objective assessment of pathological enlargement of FAZ due to capillary dropout. Based on the relationship between FAZ and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness in normal eyes| we defined a theoretical baseline FAZ (tbFAZ) on structural OCT and measured 2D and 3D vessel density in its vicinity on the simultaneously acquired OCTA in normal and diabetic eyes. We found that the structure-based tbFAZ was a reliable reference to identify foveal ischemia and that the 3D vessel density demonstrated ischemia more effectively than the 2D method. The proposed 3D para-FAZ vessel density correlates well with DR severity and potentially is a useful diagnostic biomarker| especially in the early stages of DR.,https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.10.003522,Wang B| Camino A| Pi S| Guo Y| Wang J| Huang D| Hwang TS| Jia Y.

However| the role of IOP in glaucoma progression| as well as retinal physiology in general| remains incompletely understood. We demonstrate the use of visible light optical coherence tomography to measure retinal responses to acute IOP elevation in Brown Norway rats. We monitored retinal responses in reflectivity| angiography| blood flow| oxygen saturation (sO2)| and oxygen metabolism over a range of IOP from 10 to 100 mmHg. As IOP was elevated| nerve fiber layer reflectivity was found to decrease. Vascular perfusion in the three retinal capillary plexuses remained steady until IOP exceeded 70 mmHg and arterial flow was noted to reverse periodically at high IOPs. However| a significant drop in total retinal blood flow was observed first at 40 mmHg. As IOP increased| the venous sO2 demonstrated a gradual decrease despite steady arterial sO2| which is consistent with increased arterial-venous oxygen extraction across the retinal capillary beds. Calculated total retinal oxygen metabolism was steady| reflecting balanced responses of blood flow and oxygen extraction| until IOP exceeded 40 mmHg| and fell to 0 at 70 and 80 mmHg. Above this| measurements were unattainable. All measurements reverted to baseline when the IOP was returned to 10 mmHg| indicating good recovery following acute pressure challenge. These results demonstrate the ability of this system to monitor retinal oxygen metabolism noninvasively and how it can help us understand retinal responses to elevated IOP.,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.NPh.6.4.041104,Pi S| Hormel TT| Wei X| Cepurna W| Camino A| Guo Y| Huang D| Morrison JC| Jia Y.

In this study| we propose the first deep learning solution to segment the avascular area in OCTA of DR.

With the increased scanning speeds of OCT devices and wider field images (=10 mm on fast-axis)| greater retinal curvature and anatomic variations have introduced new challenges. In this study| we developed a novel automated method to segment seven retinal layer boundaries and two retinal plexuses in wide-field OCTA images. The algorithm was initialized by a series of points forming a guidance point array that estimates the location of retinal layer boundaries. A guided bidirectional graph search method consisting of an improvement of our previous segmentation algorithm was used to search for the precise boundaries. We validated the method on normal and diseased eyes| demonstrating subpixel accuracy for all groups. By allowing independent visualization of the superficial and deep plexuses| this method shows potential for the detection of plexus-specific peripheral vascular abnormalities.,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327211896_Automated_segmentation_of_retinal_layer_boundaries_and_capillary_plexuses_in_wide-field_optical_coherence_tomographic_angiography,Guo Y| Camino A| Zhang M| Wang J| Huang D| Hwang T| Jia Y.

IEEE.,Algorithm,#,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8243687,Moving objects' detection in dynamic scenes is a very important task in video processing. In the applications of image processing (for example| video-surveillance)| more attention is paid to whether there is an interested object in the scene rather than where the object is located. As a matter of fact| similar to static backgrounds| the statistical histograms of the most dynamic backgrounds have favorable stability| and these histograms would change clearly only when big and contrasting objects enter or move out of the scenes. This is a very important and interesting property for dynamic background. We propose a fast and simple algorithm| combining histograms in multiple color spaces and the superposition principle of statistical histogram| called Multiple Color Space Histogram Models (MCSHM). MCSHM first calculates statistical histograms of many color components in multiple color space and then use the changes of statistical histograms to determine whether there is an object rather than the changes in pixels or pixel-level regions. Thus| the computational complexity of MCSHM is kept at a very low level. The basic steps are as follows: firstly| convert each frame from RGB space to other color spaces and calculate the histograms of selected color components| then we can obtain the background histogram model; secondly| detect the objects using statistical histogram superposition principle; finally| update MCSHM by the result of detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can quickly and accurately detect moving objects in dynamic scenes.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8243687,Jinping L| Yukun G| Liwen M.
